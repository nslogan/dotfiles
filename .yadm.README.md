# Logan's dotfiles

My dotfiles are managed by [yadm](https://yadm.io/).

This is very much a work in progres.

## TODO

- [ ] Add .gdbinit
- [ ] Customize .bashrc
- [ ] Customize .vimrc
- [ ] Add files to .gitignore
- [ ] Create bootstrap script (should include managing my `apt` packages, maybe a standard ARM toolchain)
- [ ] Migrate ST3 repo into this one
- [ ] Add ST3 licenses into encrypted part of yadm
