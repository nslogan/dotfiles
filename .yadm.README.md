# Logan's dotfiles

My dotfiles are managed by [yadm](https://yadm.io/).

This is very much a work in progress.

## Bootstrap

```
sudo apt -y --install-recommends install yadm
yadm clone git@github.com:nslogan/dotfiles.git
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add .gdbinit
- [ ] Customize .bashrc
- [ ] Customize .vimrc
- [ ] Add files to .gitignore
- [ ] Create bootstrap script (should include managing my `apt` packages, maybe a standard ARM toolchain)
- [ ] Migrate ST3 repo into this one
- [ ] Add ST3 licenses into encrypted part of yadm
- [ ] Add `$USER` to groups: `docker`, `dialout`, ...
- [ ] Also add some basic udev rules to make blackmagic probe, FTDI, etc. programmers work

## INBOX

To be organized.


### Disk configuration:

Carried out during machine commissioning, could be automated (?)

`/home` on separate partion
`/home/opt` mounted as /opt (https://askubuntu.com/questions/237272/how-to-put-opt-and-home-on-the-same-partition-but-different-from)

### Desktop Settings

- Remap caps to escape, both shift to caps
- Configure screen blanking to 30 minute timeout (not available in GUI)
- Disable tap-to-click on trackpad
